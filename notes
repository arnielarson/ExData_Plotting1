# Testing  - trying to use ssh, by addng following as remote: arnie2

#
# Loading the data - 2E10^6 data points..  9 fields, 7 as numeric (8 bytes), 2 as char (more..)
# is about 2E10^8 bytes - given 10^6 bytes/MB - that's about 200 MB of RAM..  
# given that my laptop is old and crappy.. I've truncated the data on loading, just the first
# 100000 rows gets the data of interest.
#
# Making the graphs - I've decided to 1. make the axis and titles the same format
# e.g capitalization and spaces, slight discrepency from what's on the assignment page
#
# Printing to file - I've decided to use the file device png(<fname>) as that uses a 
# white background by default - which is what I'd prefer for this scenario
# e.g. simply generating plot files in png format
#
# Plot files - I created the 4 R files as directed. 
# I put the loading code in plot1.R, creating a dependency on that file the
# other plotting code files.  The loading code iteself has the file location and subsetting 
# logic hardcoded.  
# I'd have preferred to separate loading and logic code out into it's own file.
#
# Each of the plotting files has a function to create a specific plot. plot4.R
# depends on each of the previous plot functions to create it's plot.
